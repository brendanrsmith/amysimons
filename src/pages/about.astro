            I make woodcut collages. Woodcut prints because from a whole comes
            many parts, and collages because those parts together become another
            whole. Printed on lightweight paper, the work breaths and sways in
            response to the viewer’s presence, impacted without direct contact.
            Contrasting with the colossal, details present in each print invite
            closer attention; focusing care for individuals within the flock.

            I am interested in touch and how it lingers in the body as a trace.
            I look at how bodies in proximity become shapes drawn together,
            repel one another, or hold tension in the space between. How do
            bodies become ecologies of mixed beings – assemblages of minerals,
            microbiomes and humanness, further mixed with memories of our past
            selves and promises of future ones? The compositions I create are
            speculative relationships.
