                I make woodcut collages. Woodcut prints because from a whole
                comes many parts, and collages because those parts together
                become another whole. Printed on lightweight paper, the work
                breaths and sways in response to the viewer’s presence, impacted
                without direct contact. Contrasting with the colossal, details
                present in each print invite closer attention; focusing care for
                individuals within the flock.

                I am interested in touch and how it lingers in the body as a
                trace. I look at how bodies in proximity become shapes drawn
                together, repel one another, or hold tension in the space
                between. How do bodies become ecologies of mixed beings –
                assemblages of minerals, microbiomes and humanness, further
                mixed with memories of our past selves and promises of future
                ones? The compositions I create are speculative relationships.
